 # Procurement Guide
For most people wanting to complete this project with a group, Element14 (au.element14.com) is the best place to acquire components from. They are based in Australia, and have pricing very similar to buying directly from suppliers overseas using a site such as Alibaba. 

Key characteristics that are needed when finding components:
- Arduino Nano – headers attached (pins along the sides)
- LEDs – through-hole, 3mm casing
- Push button – case dimensions of 6x6mm, 4 legs, through-hole, single-pole single-throw (SPST)
- Resistors – resistances of 330ohm and 1kohm, through-hole. Does not need to be more than 500mW or have a resistance tolerance of less than 1%. 

Below is a list of parts that were available at the time of writing that would be suitable for this project:
- Arduino Nano - https://au.element14.com/seeed-studio/102010268/seeeduino-board-arduino-nano-board/dp/3932117 
- 3mm Red LED - https://au.element14.com/kingbright/l-1334surtk/led-3mm-red-630nm-red-transparent/dp/4062027

- 3mm Orange LED - https://au.element14.com/multicomp/mcl034at/led-3mm-32-orange/dp/1581126 
- 3mm Yellow LED - https://au.element14.com/lumex/ssl-lx3044yc/led-3mm-yellow-90mcd-585nm/dp/7605560 
- 6x6mm push button - https://au.element14.com/apem/mjtp1230/switch-tactile-spst-50ma-through/dp/4511189 
- 330ohm resistor - https://au.element14.com/multicomp-pro/mcmf0w4ff3300a50/metal-film-resistor-330-ohm-250mw/dp/1126972 
- 1kohm resistor - https://au.element14.com/multicomp-pro/mcmf0w4ff1001a50/metal-film-resistor-1kohm-250mw/dp/1126919 

If these parts are not available, there should be similar components available. Element14 also has the option to search for similar products based of characteristics like size and colour.
